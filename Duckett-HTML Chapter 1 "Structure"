Chapter One:Structure 

Key Topics:
            1. Understanding Structure
            2. Learning about markup
            3. Tags and Elements 
   
Many web pages are just electronic versions of documents that have been around for ages.
    Newspapers, Insurance forms, shop catalogues etc. 
    And they generally follow the same structure of their non-electronic counterparts
    
Structure is used to draw the eye to the important information 
      a heading is larger to separate sections of a document, and give the reader a quick easy reference for which part of the document theyre viewing
      heading types and sizes can also quickly display a hierarchy of information. 
      Biggest heading could be a title to an article, while a smaller heading could be a subsection to said article

HTML describes the structure of pages
      You can use HTML to create these headings, and the information below each heading
      
          Example Code:
              <htmL>
                <body>
                  <h1> Heading! </h1>
                  <p> some text about the topic, maybe an introduction </p>
                  <h2> Sub-heading! </h2>
                  <p> some more imformation about the topic at hand </p>
                  <h2> Another Sub-heading! </h2>
                  <p> More info about this second subheading </p>
                 </body>
                </html>
       
       In the angled brackets above you see HTML elements. they're made up of two tags, an opening and a closing tag. 
       Each element tells the browers something about the info that is between the two tags.
       
       <html></html> are the tages that indicate that anything between these two elements are HTML code
       <body></body> tag indicates that anything within these elements are shown in the main browser window
       <h1-6></h1-6> indicate headers. 1 being the largest text, 6 being smallest
       <p></p> indicate paragraphs
       
       <p></p> analysis:
       < = left angle bracket : Opening of a tag
       p = character : indicate the tags purpose
       >  = right angle bracket : closing of a tag
       / = forward slash : needed to indicate the tag is the end of a set. 
       
 Attributes can tell use more about elements 
      attributes provide additional info about the contents of the element. 
      They appear within the opening tag and are made up of a two parts
        1. Name
        2. Value 
          The two parts are separated by an equal sign
         
            Example Code:
                <p lang ="en-us"> Paragraph in the english language</p>
                
                lang = attribute name
                en-us = attribute value 
                
             Alternate example:
                <p lang="fr">Paragraphe en Francais</p>
                
                lang = name
                fr = value
                
                **HTML5 allows yuo to use upercase attribute names and omit the quotemarks but it is best practice to use lowercase and quote marks.
                
                
Body Head and Title
      Body: <body></body> everything in this element is in the main browser window
      Head: <head></head> this contains info about the page, you'll usually find <title> in the <head> element
      Title: <title></title> this is shown at the top of the brower, the tab title, 
              allowning you to quickly discern which tab you want to go to when you have multiple open
    
    HTML stands for HyperTextMarkup Language. 
       Hypertext: refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links to other pages. 
       Markup language: allows you to annotate text. Providing additional meaning to the content of the document
                         tags we add count as markup
                        
    
    Creating a webpage on a PC
      All you need to create a webpage is a text editor such as Notepad
      There is also a free version Nodepad++ (notepad-plus-plus.org) 
      
            code: 
              <html>
                <head>
                  <title> My first Web Page </title>
                 </head>
                 <body>
                  <h1> Welcome to my first webpage! </h1>
                  <p>This is an HTML page I created in Notepad </p>
                 </body>
                </html>
                
         Save the file as an .html extension 
        Start the web browser and go to file menu and open, select the file and open it. 
         There's your first webpage!
         
Coding in a content management system
  If you're working with a content management system, such as a blogging platform or an e-commerce application. 
    you'll typically log into a special admin section to control a portion of the website. 
    This means you wont see the whole inner code of the webpage but just a sub section of the website. 
    
 Looking at how other sites are built
  You can look at how any webpage is made via code by looking at by using "view source" or by pressing f12 on windows
