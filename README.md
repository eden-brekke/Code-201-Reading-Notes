#### Common Comands
* pwd = Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
* ls = List the contents of a directory.
* cd = Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
* file = obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
* ls -a = List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
* l = Long listing
* \ = An escape character, escapes the meaning of the next character
  * Example: putting \ before an * will ignore the function of bolding a character in markdown, instead displaying the * in the text.
* .. = To back out of a directory path one step
* . = A reference to your current directory
* ~ = A shortcut for your home directory
* ls /etc = Running the List command but telling the terminal to not list your current directory, but the directories contents
* mv <source> <destination> = move a thing to a place
* cp <source> <destination> = copy a thing to a place
* rm <file> = remove a file
* mkdir = make a directory
  * -p = make a parent directory
  * -v = view an action
* n = next term
* touch <filename> = create a file with filename
* vi (or) vim = inline text editor
* control + c = copy to clipboard
  * right click = paste
* git clone URL = clone items into your IDE
* git add File = Add a file to your project
* git commit -m "Comment" = Allows you to commit the changes you've made to your main file with a comment of why the change was made
* git push URL = pushes your committed changes to your project
* git status = allows you to see the status of your changes and if you need to commit 

#### Tips and Tricks
* Use Tab to auto complete actions 
* Two Types of Paths 
  * **absolute**
  * **relative**
* Commands are stored after used. 
  * You can use your up and down arrow keys to navigate commands you've recently used.
* Everything is a file in Linux(WSL). 
  * Including directories.
* Linux(WSL) is an extensionless system. 
  * Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
* Linux(WSL) is case sensitive. 
  * This can cause silly issues.

#### Common Acronyms
* IDE = Integrated development environment
* DNS = Domain Name System
* VCS = Version Control System
* CVCS = Centralized Version Control System
* DVCS = Distributed Version Control systems 

 
#### Git
 Git is a useful tool to allow you to collaborate between multiple developers on a software project. Git allows you to easily keep track of file revisions and makes the risk of data loss less prominant. 

You can easily clone your repositories to your IDE using git from sites such as GitHub, and then you have a mantra of add-commit-push for each time you make a change! Commit allows you to make a commit of why you made a change and lets you look back and why each change was made, If a change breaks your program this process makes it easier to revert back to an old version and continue on with your beautiful working project.
 
 #### Wireframes
 Wireframes are an important step to web development, this allows you to draft a concept and structure for what you want your app or website to look like. Allowing you to get rolling on the project. Changes to the structure are expected as you continue on. <br>
 
 6 Steps of Wireframes are: <br>
1. Do Research
2. Reference Research
3. Map out user flow
4. Draft/ Sketch
5. Add Details and Test
6. Turn your wireframe into the prototype app

 #### HTML 
 HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that denotes the structure of your website. HTML is a series of elements creating the structure. An HTML element has Tags(Opening and closing) as well as attributes and contents within the tags. <br>
 HTML has both semantic (distinct meanings of the elements) and non-semantics (asethetic, presentation elements) elements available to it. <br>
 Some examples of semantic HTML elements are: nav, footer, header, article, main, strong <br>
 Some examples of non-semantic HTML elements are: div, span 

#### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight form of coding that allows you to create things such as websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation, it can range from very basic to advanced. Making it an easy way for you to share the information most important to you. <br>
Here are great resources out there to provide you with the a wonderful [Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for Markdown as well as some more advanced, but still [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for Markdown. <br> 
With these tools, building your website is only a few keystrokes, some clicks, a bit of *google fu* and a mindset away. <br>
Mindset you ask? There are two common Mindsets when you're in a learning environment. Fixed Mindset, and Growth Mindset. <br>

#### Growth Mindset
|Fixed Mindset| **Versus** |Growth Mindset|
|:---:|:---:| :---: |
|To *Fail*| **Tendency** |To *Succeed*|
|*Daunting*| **Challenges** |*Exciting*|
|*Waning* Focus| **Obstacles** |Interesting *Challenge*|
|*Pointless*| **Effort** |*No Pain, No Gain*|
|Will *ignore*| **Critisism** |Will *learn* from|
|Is *discouraging*| **Success of Others** |Is *Inspiring*|


##### What does a Growth Mindset mean to me?

To have a **growth mindset**, it means that you are willing to step out of your <em>comfort zone</em>.
It is the idea that even though you don't know something about a topic, that doesn't mean that you can't learn about the topic. 
If you go into a topic without any knowledge, even if you end up failing, you can pick yourself back up and learn from your failings and mistakes, and realize that those mistakes were an important part of the learning process. 


##### Reminders of How to stay in a growth mindset

1. **Mistakes** are <em>important</em> and <em>essential</em> to the learning process
2. Give your mind **breaks**, let the information digest, don't forget to <em>ask for help</em>
3. Stay diligent and **keep trying**, remember that <em>google</em> is a great friend <br>

## HTML and CSS Introduction
 
#####Sub sections:
1. About this book
2. How the web works
3. Learning from other pages


1. About this book :
  Introduction: There are intro pages for each chapter, introducing the key topics of each chapter
  Reference: which introduce the key pieces of HTML/CSS code. HTML in blue and CSS in pink
  Background: white pages that explain the context
  Diagram: dark pages showing infographics. Simple visual reference 
  Example: show a working example of the key topics
  Summary: summarize what the chapter went over
  
  
 Is it hard to learn? No! Code can look complicated at a glance but if you take the time to break it down piece by piece it's rather simple and follows logical rules. 
 
 Structure of this book: Three sections  
      Section 1.HTML: first chapter will look at HTML and how its used to create web pages.
        you can start by simply writing what you want to appear on your page
        then you add tages or elements to the words so that the browser knows what you want each set of words to be, a heading or a paragraph as an example. 
        the rest of this section will introduce us to the tags at our disposal with HTML
            texts
            links
            images
            tables
            forms
            video audio
            flash
            miscellaneous elemets
        these may not be the most exciting but theyre important building blocks
      
      Section 2. CSS: This section starts with how CS uses rules to style your HTML webpages
        Look at a variety of CSS properties. Generally these properties fall into one of two categories:
             Presentation: How to control things such as color of text, fonts, size of text, background colors, and background images
             Layout: These control where the different elements are positioned on the screen. Making the site more attractive
        
      Section 3: Practical: The book ends with some helpful info that helps in building better websites. 
        Some new tags for HTML5 which help describe the structure of the pages. (HTML5 being the newest version of HTML)
        Before learning this it's important to have a grasp on CSS. 
        These chapters will talk about the design process that I can follow in creating a new site
        Then there are topics that will help us put it on the web, Search Enginge optimisation (SEO) and analytics software to track who comes to the site
      
How people access the web:
      Browsers: such as chrome, firefox, safari etc.
      Web servers: When you use your brower the request of going to a site is sent to a webserver which hosts the site.
                   web servers are computers that are constantly connected to the internet and optimized to send web pages.
                   Some big comparies run their own webservers but its more common to use the service of a webhosting company
      Devices: Desktops, laptops, tablets, mobline phones. 
      Screen Readers: Programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to the user.
                      It's important to keep in mind screen readers when you're desiging your code 
                      Throughout this book we'll see references to them and how to ensure our site are accessible to people who use this software
                      
How Websites are created: : All websites used HTML and CSS but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies.
       What you see: web browser interprets the HTML/CSS code you create. 
                     Most sites include extra content such as images, audio, video, or animations.
                     Some sites also send JavaScript or Flash, these are advanced topics touched on later (different book)
       How it is created: Small websites just use HTML/CSS
                          Larger websites make use of technologies that are used to produce HTML and CSS that is sent to the browser
                          More complex sites may use a database to store data, and programming languages such as PHP, ASP.net Java or Ruby on a web server. 
       HTML5 & CSS3: These are the most recent versions oF HTML and CSS, they build on previous versions of the languages. 
       
       
How the web works: Communication between your computer and a Domain Name System (DNS) server 
                   1. Connect to the web vis Internet service provider (ISP)
                   2. Computer contacts a network (DNS)
                   3. Unique number of DNS server returns to your computer and allows the browers to contact the web server. 
                   4. Web server sends back the page you requested
 
 
 
## HTML and CSS Chapter 1
 
 Chapter One:Structure 

#####Key Topics:
            1. Understanding Structure
            2. Learning about markup
            3. Tags and Elements 
   
Many web pages are just electronic versions of documents that have been around for ages.
    Newspapers, Insurance forms, shop catalogues etc. 
    And they generally follow the same structure of their non-electronic counterparts
    
Structure is used to draw the eye to the important information 
      a heading is larger to separate sections of a document, and give the reader a quick easy reference for which part of the document theyre viewing
      heading types and sizes can also quickly display a hierarchy of information. 
      Biggest heading could be a title to an article, while a smaller heading could be a subsection to said article

HTML describes the structure of pages
      You can use HTML to create these headings, and the information below each heading
      
          Example Code:
              <htmL>
                <body>
                  <h1> Heading! </h1>
                  <p> some text about the topic, maybe an introduction </p>
                  <h2> Sub-heading! </h2>
                  <p> some more imformation about the topic at hand </p>
                  <h2> Another Sub-heading! </h2>
                  <p> More info about this second subheading </p>
                 </body>
                </html>
       
       In the angled brackets above you see HTML elements. they're made up of two tags, an opening and a closing tag. 
       Each element tells the browers something about the info that is between the two tags.
       
       <html></html> are the tages that indicate that anything between these two elements are HTML code
       <body></body> tag indicates that anything within these elements are shown in the main browser window
       <h1-6></h1-6> indicate headers. 1 being the largest text, 6 being smallest
       <p></p> indicate paragraphs
       
       <p></p> analysis:
       < = left angle bracket : Opening of a tag
       p = character : indicate the tags purpose
       >  = right angle bracket : closing of a tag
       / = forward slash : needed to indicate the tag is the end of a set. 
       
 Attributes can tell use more about elements 
      attributes provide additional info about the contents of the element. 
      They appear within the opening tag and are made up of a two parts
        1. Name
        2. Value 
          The two parts are separated by an equal sign
         
            Example Code:
                <p lang ="en-us"> Paragraph in the english language</p>
                
                lang = attribute name
                en-us = attribute value 
                
             Alternate example:
                <p lang="fr">Paragraphe en Francais</p>
                
                lang = name
                fr = value
                
                **HTML5 allows yuo to use upercase attribute names and omit the quotemarks but it is best practice to use lowercase and quote marks.
                
                
Body Head and Title
      Body: <body></body> everything in this element is in the main browser window
      Head: <head></head> this contains info about the page, you'll usually find <title> in the <head> element
      Title: <title></title> this is shown at the top of the brower, the tab title, 
              allowning you to quickly discern which tab you want to go to when you have multiple open
    
    HTML stands for HyperTextMarkup Language. 
       Hypertext: refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links to other pages. 
       Markup language: allows you to annotate text. Providing additional meaning to the content of the document
                         tags we add count as markup
                        
    
    Creating a webpage on a PC
      All you need to create a webpage is a text editor such as Notepad
      There is also a free version Nodepad++ (notepad-plus-plus.org) 
      
            code: 
              <html>
                <head>
                  <title> My first Web Page </title>
                 </head>
                 <body>
                  <h1> Welcome to my first webpage! </h1>
                  <p>This is an HTML page I created in Notepad </p>
                 </body>
                </html>
                
         Save the file as an .html extension 
        Start the web browser and go to file menu and open, select the file and open it. 
         There's your first webpage!
         
Coding in a content management system
  If you're working with a content management system, such as a blogging platform or an e-commerce application. 
    you'll typically log into a special admin section to control a portion of the website. 
    This means you wont see the whole inner code of the webpage but just a sub section of the website. 
    
 Looking at how other sites are built
  You can look at how any webpage is made via code by looking at by using "view source" or by pressing f12 on windows 
  
#####Chapter 1 Summary: 
 - HTML pages are text documents
 - HTML uses text tags to give info a meaning
 - Tags are referred to as elements
 - Tags come in pairs, opening and closing
 - Opening tags can carry attributes, telling us more about the content within the tags
 - Attributes require a name and a value 
 - To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go
        

## HTML and CSS Chapter 8
  Chapter 8: Extra Markup (p176-199)

#####Key Topics: 
  - Specifying different versions 
  - Identifying and Grouping Elements 
  - Comments, meta information and iframes 
  
  Helpful topics covered in this chapter:
    - Different versions of HTML and how to indicate which version youre using
    - how to add comments to code
    - global attribute: which can be used on any element (class and id attributes)
    - elements that are used to group together parts of the page 
    - how to embed a page within a page using iframes
    - add info about a page using <meta>
    - add characters such as angled brackets and copyright symbols
    
  
  Versions of HTML: 
    HTML 4(1997) Most the same as HTML5 but used presentational elements that arent recommended anymore, such as <center> and <font>
    XHTML 1.0 (2000) HTML was reformated to follow rules of XML. 
                     Made it so every elemeted needed a closing tage besides imgs
                     Attribute names had to be lowercase
                     attributes required a value and values were put in quotes
                     deprecated elements should no longer be used
                     every element that was opened inside another element should be closed inside the same element
                  Two flavors of XHTML:
                          strict: author had to follow rules to the letter
                          transitional: could still use <center> <font> etc. 
                       A third was called: Frameset. allowing authors to partition windows into several frames, each holding different HTML code
                                           These are very rarely used, being phased out. 
     HTML5 (in progress during this books publication process): authors dont need to close all tags, new elements, new attributes 
     
    
  DOCTYPES
      The doctype allows the webpage to know which type of HTML you are using
      
      HTML5 : <!DOCTYPE html>
      HTML4 : <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC -- links found on pg 181>
      Transitional HTML1.0/Strict HTML1.0 Same as HTML4 but different links, on pg 181
      XML Declaration : <?xml version="1.0" ?>
      
   Comments in HTML
        to write comments (not included in the code but rather a note to whoever is reading the code) use <!-- Comment here! -->
        
   ID attribute: 
         Every element can carry an ID attribute. start with an underscore(_) or a letter, no other character and make sure never to use repeat ID's for elements.
         this allows you to call each ID and treat them differently. (with HTML or with CSS or JS later) 
         ID is known as a global attribute, because it can be used on any element
    
   Class Attribute: 
         Every element can carry a class attribute 
         This allows you to indetify more than one element with the same class.
         Example: some elements you might want to class as important 
         
   Block Elements: 
        Some elements will always appear to start ona new line in the browser window. 
          Examples of elememts are <h1> <p> <ul> or <li> 
       
   Inline elements: 
         Some elements will always appear to coninue on the sameline, as their neighboring elements. These are Inline
          Examples of inline elements are <a> <b> <em> or <img>
   
   Grouping Text and Elements in a Block
        <div> element allows you to group of a set of elements together
          Example: us <div> to contain all the elements in a headers of your site 
                    such as the logo and navigation links
          You can use an id or class attribute on a div element to create a CSS style rule for the whole block
          div also allows you to organize your code 
          
    Grouping Text and elements Inline
        <span> element acts like an inline equiv to <div> 
            It's used to either: 
                1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to diffrentiate it from its surrounding text
                2. Contain a number of inline elements
         Most common reason people use <span> is to control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS
            You will ususally see that a class or id is used with <span> elements, so as to:
                - Expain the purpose of the span element
                - so CSS styles can be used to style just that element within the element. 
                
      Iframes:
        <iframe> is like a little window that has been cut into your page
              Example of iframe: google maps
                                  the content within an iframe can be any HTML code
               Created by using an <iframe> element
                  You'll need to know a few attrbutes to use iframes
                        src : specifies URL of page shown in the frame
                        height : specifies pixels alloted for height of frame
                        width : specifies pixel alloted for width of frame
                        scrolling: (not supported in HTML5) but was usedto indicate whether iframe had scroll bars, if page was larger than alloted space
                                    yes = show, no = dont show, and auto = show only if needed
                        frameborder: (not supported in HTML5) whether the grame should have a border or not
                        seamless: new in HTML5, applied to iframe where scrollbars arent desired. Doesnt need a value, but you'll often see values anyway. 
                                  Older browers don't support seamless attribute. 
                
       Information about your pages:
          <meta> element lives inside the <head> portion of your code and contains info about the webpage
            It's not visible to the users but can help by telling the search enginges about your page
              Info such as: author of page, whether or not it is time sensitive (if it is time sensitive it can be se tto expire) 
             <meta> is an empty element so it doesn't need a closing tag
                     and uses attribute to carry the info
                        Most common attributes: name and content which are usually used together
                        
              Value of the name attribute can be anything you want it to be.
              Some defined values for this attribute that are commonly used:
                Description: Contains description of page
                             Example code:
                                <meta name = "Description"
                                    content = "An Essay on Installation" />
                Keywords: list of comma, separated words the user might search to find the page (in practice this no longer has any noticable effect)
                          Example:
                            <meta name = "keywords"
                                contents ="installation. art. opinion" />
                Robots: whether search enginges should add this page to their search or not. 
                          noindex: should not be added
                          nofollow: should add to results but not the pages that it links to
                            example:
                              <meta name = "robots"
                                  content = "nofollow" />
                       
            The <meta> element uses http-equiv and content attributes in pairs. 
              Three instances of http-equiv attributes:
                  1. author : defines the author of web page
                              Example:
                                   <meta http-equiv="author"
                                     content="Eden" />
                  2. pragma : prevents browser from caching page
                               (where caching is storing it locally to save time downloading it on subsequent visits)
                               Example:
                                    <meta http-equiv="pragma"
                                      content="no-cache" />
                  3. expires : because browsers often cache the contents of a page, the expires option indicates when that cache expires. 
                                date must follow example:
                                    <meta http-equiv="expires"
                                      content="Fri. 04 Apr 2022 23:59:59 PST" /> 
                                      
 Escape Characters
    There are characters that are used and reserved by HTML code (Such as < and > ) 
      Therefore if you want the characters to appear within your page you need to use the escape characters
      You can use the escape codes: &1t; or &#60; if you want to use < in your page. 
      You can find these escape codes on page 194 of Duckett HTML/CSS book 
      some common ones 
      < = &lt;
      > = &gt;
      & = &amp;
      " =&quot;
      copyright = &copy;
      trademark = &trade;
      registered trademark = &reg;
      multiplication = &times;
      Division = &divide;
      left single quote/double quote = &lsquo; / &ldquo;
      right single quote/double quote = &rsquo; / &rdquo; 
      

##### Summary Chapter 8 Eztra Markup:
  
  - DOCUTYPES tell browser which version of HTML you are using
  - You can add comments <!-- -->
  - id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements
  - <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together
  - <iframes> cut windows into your webpage
  - <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of info 
  - escape characters are used to include special characters
         

         
## HTML and CSS Chapter 17
        Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout

#####Key Topics
    - HTML5 Layout Elements
    - How old browers understand new elements
    - Styling HTML5 Layout elements with CSS
    
   
   
Before HTML5 You would use <div> to id parts of a page such as the header, the navigation bar, and different articles within a page
      before: <div id = "header"> 
        After: <header>
      before: <div id = "'nav">
        after: <nav>
      before: <div id = "content">
                <div class = "article">
                <div class = "article">
        after: <div id = "content">
                 <article>
                 <article>
      before: <div id = "footer">
        after: <footer>
        
        
 Headers and Footers <header> <footer>
    The main header or footer appear at the top and bottom of the page respectably 
    There can also be a header or footer for each individual article within a page as well. 
    <section> can also have a header or footer. 

Navigation <nav>
    the nav elementis used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site
    this is usually a unordered list with each list item containing a link within the site
        either to other pages of the site or down to a portion of the same page that is indicated with an id
        
 Articles <article>
    Article elements act as contianers for any secction of a page that could stand alone. 
        such as a blog entry, a comment, or a forum post 
     A page can contain multiple articles, each having their own opening and closing article tags
        Article tags can even be nested within each other. 
        
 Asides <aside>
    An aside element has two purposes depending on whether it is inside or outside an <article> element
        1. inside an <article> it should contain info related to the artile but not essential to the overall meaning
            (So a pullquote or glossary might be an aside)
        2. outside of an article, an <aside> can act as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
            (Might be links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, a search box, etc)
            
 Sections <section>
     The <section> element groups related content together.
     Typically each section will have its own heading
        Example: homepage might have several sections
                    - latest news
                    - top products 
                    - newsletter sign ups etc.
         Alternatively: long articles can be split up into separate sections
      Section should not wrap the entire page, that's still best left for <div>
     
Heading Groups: <hgroup>
    Purpose for <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1-6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading. 
          Example: hgroup elements could be used to conain both a title inside <h2> and a subtitle within <h3>
                <hgroup>
                  <h2>Vegetarian</h2>
                  <h3>Five week course</h3>
                </hgroup>
     
     This element has mixed reception. Some say it has little use. 
     
Figures <figure> <figcaption>
    figure used to contain content in reference from mainflow of article
    examples:
        - images
        - videos
        - graphs
        - diagrams 
        - code samples
        - text that supports main body
        
       <figure> should contain <figcaption> to provide a text description for contents 
            can be added within an article element 
            
Sectioning Elements <div>
    <div> will always remain important for grouping related elements 
  
Linking around block-level elements
    html5 allows authors to place a link <a> element around a block level element, turning the whole block into a link
    
Helping older browsers understand
    old browsers dont know the new HTML5 elelements and will treat them as inline elements 
    
    CSS:
    header, section, footer, aside, nav, article, figure, figcaption {
      display: block;}
      
    HTML:
    <!--[if lt IE 9]
        <script src="http://htm5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
     <![endif]-->
     
     
Nice code examples on pg 445-448**

#####Summary Chapter 17 
      - new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help describe its structure
      - new elements provide clearer code
      - older browers don't understand HTML5 need a workaround

   Be consistent in your style and colorings. 
   
   Concise: navigation should be quick and easy to read 
   Clear: Site should be predictable
   Selective: Dont put everything together, put navigation at one place, contact info at another, login options in another
   Context: provide context to let userrs know where they are in a site
   Interactive: links should be interactive, big enough to click on, change when the user hovers over them. different than other text on the page

      - design is about communication. visual hierarchy help visitors understand what you are trying to tell them
      - you can differentiate between pieces of info using size, color, and style
      - you can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the info you present. 
 

     
## JavaScript and jQuery Introduction
Introduction: JavaScript and Jquery: interactivr front-end web development 


Javascript makes web pages more interactive

1. Access content 
    You can us JS to select any element, attribute or text from an HTML page 
        - Select text from h1 on a page
        - select any element with a class attribute with a value of note
        - find out what was entered into text input whose id attribute has a value of email
2. Modify content 
    You can use JS to add elements, attributes and text to the page, or remove them. 
        - add a paragraph of text after the first h1 element
        - change the value of class attribute to trigger new css rules for those elements 
        - change the size or position of an <img> element
3. program rules
    You can specify a set of steps for the browers to follow (like a recipe) which allows it to access or change the content of the page
        - gallery script could checkwhich img a user cliced on and display a larger version of that img
        - a mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perfrm a calculation and display repayments
        - an animation could check the domensions of the browers window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable are (also known as the viewport)
4. React to events
    you can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
        - a button is pressed
        - a link is clicked
        - a cursor hovers over an element
        - information is added to a form
        - an interval of time has passed
        - a web page has finished loading
        
       
Structure of the book:

## JavaScript and jQuery Chapter 1
 
##### Chapter 1: The ABCs of programming

A. What is a script and how do I create one. 
B. How do computers fit in with the world around them?
C. How do I write a script for a web page? 

A. Script is a set of instructions
    like a recipe, a handbook, or manuals. 
    Scripts are made up of a instructions a computer can follow step-by-step
    A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the webpage
    Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them 
    
    To write script first: state your goals. list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
       1. Define the goal
       2. design the script
       3. code each step 
       
     Flow chart: Tasks of a hotel cleaner
     Check each room
        Does the room need tidying?
              yes: tidy room 
                    Step1 remove bedding
                    2 wipe all surfaces
                    3 vacuum floor
                    4 fit new bedding
                    5 remove used towels and soaps
                    6 clean toilet bath sink and surfaces
                    7 place new towels and soap
                    8 wipe bathroom floor
                    9 repeat check
              no: move to next step
         Does the mini bar need restocking?
               yes: restock then run check again
               no: move to next step
         Move to next room
      
Need to learn: 
    Vocabulary: text that computer understands
    Syntax: how to put that text into instructions the computer can follow
Computers solver problems programmatically, by following a series of istructions on after the other. 
  Type of instructions they need are often different from the type we as humans would need, Needs step by step instructions 
  
  To design the script you should draw out a flowchart

#####Summary of 1A:
- script is a series of instructions that the cmputer can follow in order to achieve a goal
- each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all instructions
- computers approach the task in a different way than humans, so your instruction must let the computer solve the task programmatically
- to approach writing a script break down your goal into a series of tasks then work out each step needed to complete the task (a flowchart can help)


####Chapter 1B: How do computers fit in with the world around them?

Computers create models of the world using data. 
    Objects: things: each object can have its own
        - properties
        - events
        - methods
     Properties : characteristics : each property has
        - name
        - value
       
    Events: What is an event?
        The computers way of sticking up its hand and saying "hey this just happened"
    What does an event do?
         The programmers choose which eventsthey respond to. 
         When specific events happen, that even can trigger apsecific sections of the code
         
     Methods: represent things people need to do with objects. 
          They can retrieve or update the values of an objects properties 
        What is a method?
            Methods typically represent how people or other things interact with an object in the real world. 
        What does a method do? 
             The code for a method can contain lots of instrctions that together represent one task. 
             
   Example:
   Objecttype: document
   Properties: 
      URL: www.example.com/
      Last modified: today!
      title: learning code
    Event: Happens when
       load : page and assests have loaded
       click : user clisk something
       keypress : user pressed key
     Method: what it do
        write() : adds new content to the docment 
        getElementByld() accesses an element when you state its id attribute
        
        
  How a browers sees a web page
     1. receieve a page as HTML code
     2. create a model of the page and store it in memory
     3. use a rendering engine to show the page on screen
     
###### Summary of chapter 1B How do computers fit in with the world around them? 
    - computers create models of the world using data
    - the models use objects to represent physical things. 
            objects can have: properties that tell us about the object; 
            methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object; 
            events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer 
     - programmers can write code to say "when this event occurs, run that code"
     - web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page. Each element creates its own node 
     - to make webpages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page
     
  
####Chapter 1C How do I write a script for a webpage?
  
  HTML : content layers
  CSS : presentation layer 
  JS : behavior layers 
  
  Link your JS to your HTML files 
  
###### Summary 1C 
  - keep your JS codein its own JS file. 
  - HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the brower to load the JS file 
  - view the source code of the page in the browers. JS will not change the HTML, script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
