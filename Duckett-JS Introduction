Introduction: JavaScript and Jquery: interactivr front-end web development 


Javascript makes web pages more interactive

1. Access content 
    You can us JS to select any element, attribute or text from an HTML page 
        - Select text from h1 on a page
        - select any element with a class attribute with a value of note
        - find out what was entered into text input whose id attribute has a value of email
2. Modify content 
    You can use JS to add elements, attributes and text to the page, or remove them. 
        - add a paragraph of text after the first h1 element
        - change the value of class attribute to trigger new css rules for those elements 
        - change the size or position of an <img> element
3. program rules
    You can specify a set of steps for the browers to follow (like a recipe) which allows it to access or change the content of the page
        - gallery script could checkwhich img a user cliced on and display a larger version of that img
        - a mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perfrm a calculation and display repayments
        - an animation could check the domensions of the browers window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable are (also known as the viewport)
4. React to events
    you can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
        - a button is pressed
        - a link is clicked
        - a cursor hovers over an element
        - information is added to a form
        - an interval of time has passed
        - a web page has finished loading
